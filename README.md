## Plan
- done:
> 1. Machine Learning (Stanford Andrew NG's)
- present:
> 1. hands_on_Ml_with_Sklearn_and_TF
> 2. try kaggle competition.

- future
> 1. complete Deep learning course (on coursera too)
> 2. review linear algebra.

I don't want to plan too concretely because i would flexible adjust. But just one thing to remember:
> __study assiduously and perseveringly__
